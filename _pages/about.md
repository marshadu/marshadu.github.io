Welcome! I am **Muhammad Umer Arshad**, a Postdoctoral Researcher in the [**Department of Crop Sciences at the University of Illinois Urbana‚ÄìChampaign (UIUC)**](https://dkleelab.cropsci.illinois.edu/umer-arshad/).  
My research focuses on the intersection of **agricultural economics, climate change, and sustainable bioenergy systems**. I apply a diverse set of quantitative and modeling approaches to evaluate agricultural systems, bioenergy feedstocks, and farmer decision-making. My expertise includes econometric methods such as Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA), Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), ARDL, Johansen co-integration, unit root testing, panel regression (fixed and random effects), and gravity modeling. I also conduct experimental and field data analysis using ANOVA, LSD post hoc tests, Shapiro‚ÄìWilk normality testing, and a range of diagnostic and specification tests for model robustness. For biophysical processes, I use the DayCent process-based model to simulate crop yields, soil carbon, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, often integrated with GIS and remote sensing tools (ArcGIS, QGIS) for spatial analysis. To understand farmer behavior, I design and analyze surveys that draw on behavioral economics frameworks, including adoption of crop insurance, e-commerce, and conservation practices. At the systems level, I employ Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) using the GREET model and Techno-Economic Analysis (TEA) to quantify trade-offs between profitability and sustainability in renewable and conventional farming systems. My technical toolkit spans R, Stata, and Python for econometric modeling and statistical computing, supported by advanced data visualization and multi-year, multi-site dataset management.

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.
