I am currently working on identifying marginal lands suitable for switchgrass production across Illinois. This project combines long-term cropland data, soil characteristics, and productivity indices to pinpoint areas with limited potential for conventional crops but strong suitability for perennial bioenergy grasses. The goal is to map and evaluate these sites as part of a broader sustainability assessment using the DayCent model. In future posts, I will share step-by-step details of the spatial workflow, data layers used, and how the results will be integrated into model simulations and economic analysis.
