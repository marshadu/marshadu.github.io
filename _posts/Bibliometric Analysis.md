# How to Write a Bibliometric Analysis Paper Using Web of Science and CiteSpace

## 1. Importance of Bibliometric Analysis  

In the modern research landscape, the volume of publications on any topic increases exponentially each year. Traditional reviews often fail to capture the global patterns, influential authors, and thematic evolution of a field. **Bibliometric analysis** fills this gap by quantitatively evaluating and visualizing the structure of scientific knowledge.

### Why This Type of Study Matters  
1. **Map Research Development** – Track how a discipline has evolved over time and identify key milestones.  
2. **Identify Hotspots and Trends** – Detect emerging research areas and frequently used keywords.  
3. **Analyze Collaboration Networks** – Visualize how authors, institutions, and countries interact in the research ecosystem.  
4. **Assess Influence and Impact** – Highlight the most cited authors, papers, and journals.  
5. **Guide Future Research** – Reveal underexplored topics and knowledge gaps for future study.  
6. **Support Policy and Strategy** – Provide insights for decision-making in funding, research management, and academic planning.  

Bibliometric analysis integrates **quantitative rigor** with **visual storytelling**, making it a powerful method for papers published in journals like *Land*, *Sustainability*, and *Environmental Sciences*.

## 2. Type of Study  

This is a **quantitative literature review** that examines existing publications through citation data, co-occurrence patterns, and network visualization.  
It does not involve experiments or surveys but instead uses systematic data retrieval and computational analysis to describe the intellectual landscape of a field.

## 3. Data Source and Collection  

### Step 1: Access Web of Science  
Visit [**Web of Science Smart Search**](https://www.webofscience.com/wos/alldb/smart-search) and construct a topic-based query relevant to your field.  

Example queries:
TS=("intangible cultural heritage" AND tourism)

nginx
Copy code
or  
TS=("bioenergy crops" OR "climate-smart agriculture")

markdown
Copy code

### Step 2: Set Filters  
- **Database:** Web of Science Core Collection  
- **Timespan:** 2000–2024  
- **Language:** English  
- **Document Type:** Articles and Reviews  

### Step 3: Export Data  
Each export in Web of Science is limited to **1,000 records**, so large datasets must be downloaded in parts:  
savedrecs.xls
savedrecs (1).xls
savedrecs (2).xls
...

python
Copy code
Save all files in a single folder (e.g., your **Downloads** directory).

## 4. Merging Multiple Files Using Python  

To analyze your complete dataset, merge all `.xls` files into a single Excel sheet.  
Open Jupyter Notebook and run the following Python script:

```python
import os
import pandas as pd
from glob import glob

# Folder containing all exported files
downloads = os.path.expanduser("~/Downloads")

# Identify all Excel files starting with 'savedrecs'
files = glob(os.path.join(downloads, "savedrecs*.xls"))

# Read and merge all files
dataframes = [pd.read_excel(f) for f in files]
merged_df = pd.concat(dataframes, ignore_index=True).drop_duplicates()

# Save final merged dataset
output_file = os.path.join(downloads, "merged_wos.xlsx")
merged_df.to_excel(output_file, index=False)

print(f"Merged dataset saved at: {output_file}")
This creates one consolidated file named merged_wos.xlsx that includes all records without duplicates.

5. Data Cleaning and Preparation
Open merged_wos.xlsx and verify columns such as Title, Author, Keywords, Source, Year, and DOI.

Rename inconsistent column headers if necessary.

Remove irrelevant or duplicate records.

Save the cleaned dataset as wos_clean.xlsx — this will be imported into CiteSpace.

6. Performing Bibliometric Analysis Using CiteSpace
Step 1: Install and Open CiteSpace
Download CiteSpace (Java-based) and launch it.
Choose Data → Import Web of Science data to load your cleaned file.

Step 2: Configure Parameters
Time Slicing: 2000–2024

Years per Slice: 1

Node Types: Author, Institution, Country, Keyword, Category

Selection Criteria: Top 50 per slice

Step 3: Run Analyses
Use CiteSpace to visualize:

Co-authorship Networks – Identify influential authors, institutions, and countries.

Co-citation Networks – Discover foundational papers and journals.

Keyword Co-occurrence and Clustering – Reveal main research themes.

Burst Detection – Identify emerging and rapidly growing topics.

Step 4: Export and Interpret Results
Save maps and tables generated by CiteSpace.
Common visual outputs include:

Annual publication trends

Keyword co-occurrence maps

Cluster timelines

Collaboration networks

8. Outputs and Visualization


Figures: Publication trends, keyword networks, cluster timelines.
Tables: Top 10 authors, institutions, countries, and most cited papers.
Cluster Labels: Key thematic areas extracted by CiteSpace.
These visual results form the core of your Results and Discussion sections.

9. Summary
Bibliometric analysis enables researchers to transform raw publication data into meaningful insights about a field’s evolution, structure, and future direction.
By combining Web of Science data collection, Python-based merging and cleaning, and CiteSpace visualization, you can produce a transparent, reproducible, and visually compelling paper aligned with MDPI standards.

This workflow helps identify who is leading the research, what topics dominate discussion, and how scholarship evolves—offering a valuable guide for academics, policymakers, and future researchers alike.
