# 2025 Enterprise Budget for Hemp Production

This page provides the hemp enterprise budget for three production scenarios:
**Grain**, **Fiber**, and **Dual-Purpose**.  
Farmers can select a scenario, enter yield, acres, and delivery distance, and the sheet will automatically calculate **revenue**, **expenses**, and **break-even points**.

## 📘 How to Use the Spreadsheet (Simple Instructions)

- Select **Scenario** (Grain, Fiber, or Dual) from the dropdown.
- Enter **Grain yield (lbs/ac)**, **Fiber yield (tons/ac)**, **Acres**, and **Delivery distance (miles)**.
- Light **blue** cells = prices/assumptions (you can change these).
- Light **green** and **peach** cells = formulas (do not edit).
- **Revenue** is calculated automatically based on selected scenario.
- **Expenses** include seed rate, fertilizer, custom operations, and delivery.
- **Break-even point** shows how many pounds/tons are needed to cover total cost.
- For **Dual-purpose**, break-even assumes cost is shared **50/50** between grain and fiber.
- Delivery rules:
  - **Grain**: $/bushel using 44 lb per bushel.
  - **Fiber**: Truck holds 33 bales; 1 ton = 2 bales; cost = $4 per truck per mile.

## 📝 Notes
- Edit price assumptions (blue cells) as markets change.
- Check formulas (green/peach cells) are not altered.
- Works for any field size—just change acres.
